Gotta getcha for me now, oo-oh
I know I gotta getcha for me now, oo-oh

I know I-I-I
I know I-I-I
I know I-I-I

Life, life could be fine
Doing things together
Any kind of weather
Don't waste precious time
Make your heart surrender
Get it on together

I, I always knew
We were for each other
Living to discover
Dreams, really come true
Nothing could be better
So get it together

Gotta getcha for me now oo-oh
I know I gotta getcha for me now oo-oh

You, in my embrace
Something to remember
Love you to surrender
There, right in your face
I can hear you calling
A new love is dawning
Day after sweet day
We will love each other
Living to discover
Dreams, really can stay
Nothing could be better
So get it together

Gotta getcha for me now oo-oh
I know I gotta getcha for me now oo-oh
I know I gotta getcha your love somehow oo-oh
I know I gotta getcha for me now oo-oh

Locked inside a moment
When you feel a little lonely
Well now I have the remedy
Why don't you spend some with me
It's not so very hard to do
Just look at me, say I love you
I really think I care for you
Come on it's really easy

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Gotta getcha for me now
I know I gotta getcha for me now oo-oh oo-oh
I know I gotta getcha your love somehow
